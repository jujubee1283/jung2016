	<h2>History</h2>
	<p class="section">I was born in Southern California, and lived in an area that would be considered "the projects" until I was 10. My parents were refugees from Cambodia. They came to the United States to escape the Khmer Rouge genocide. As a child, I didn't view the home or area we lived in as small, poor, or dangerous. I remember a lot of fun times playing with the neighbor kids (most who are also part of refugee families). When I was 10, our family of 6 moved to Fresno, CA to be closer to relatives on my dad's side of the family. The relatives were in the donut selling business, so my parents were able to work at one of the donut shops. We moved into a 3 bedroom and 2 bathroom home that we seriously thought was a mansion. I remember the first day there, we were running back and forth from one end to the other, amazed at how much space there was. Of course, moving from a 600 sqft home to a 1700 sqft home will have that effect. It was a smart move because the neighborhoods were safe and the schools were better.</p>
	<p class="section">We had all the tools we needed to grow up healthy and get a good education. I decided to choose a computer-related major for college for 1 simple reasons: I liked computers. Turns out, I had no idea what computer science was when I was in high school, and I was lucky that I actually do end up liking the subject. I know people who chose it for the same reasons and had to switch majors when they found out what it really meant, and whether or not they were cut out for it. It's great that high schools nowadays have some programming classes so students can get a taste for it before they choose a major for college. Anyway, I'm glad I chose it versus something else that my traditional Asian parents were kind of pushing for.</p>
	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
	<p class="section">Being in the Bay Area, there are so many great places to eat at. I've tried a lot of them, but I usually frequent the places that I'm sure of, like Sushirrito, Ramen Underground, Escape from NY Pizza, or the banh mi place with a name I still don't know. Trying new places involves risk of a bad meal or upsetting my somewhat finicky stomach. In addition to most Asian cuisine, I also like pizza, burgers, and seafood.</p>
	<p class="section">I started watching anime back in high school and in college, I took all the Japanese language classes my school had to offer. Sadly it was not much, only 4 quarters worth. I don't claim to like everything about Japanese culture or media, but I do like the language a lot. I like the way the spoken language sounds and the way it looks when written. On my first international trip, I went to Japan by myself. I wanted to use my own knowledge to get around Japan on my own (and to not speak English at all). The locals I stayed with took me to places and were a good source for practicing my Japanese since they didn't speak English at all. I did miss English sometime, since converting to Japanese in my head took a lot of effort, but overall it was worth it to know I was able to get around using Japanese. I still study Japanese, but on my own and sporadically. My goal now is to be able to read untranslated comic books or short stories. Also, I'll be visiting Japan again.</p>
	<p class="section">I like watching TV, but I easily get restless so I don't do long sessions. I like sitcoms like Big Bang Theory, The Office, Parks and Recreation, and Friends. I like to read sci-fi/fantasy novels and it's usually what I do on my 1.5 hour roundtrip commute to work. I used to really like playing long RPG video games (i.e. FF 7-10), but similar to watching tv, I find I get restless with that too. I still play games from time to time though. I started liking number puzzles because of Sudoku, which they had in the  college newsletters at the time. Sudoku is no longer my favorite though. I like Slitherlink, Kakuro, and 'Hashi o Kakero' more. Other hobbies include origami,learning baton twirling from Youtube, and journaling. I still keep a physical journal.</p>
